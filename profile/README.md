Laminar replaces brittle RPA scripts with computer use agents that see the screen, adapt to UI changes, and recover from errors without human intervention. Running in production across major EHR systems.

### How it works

```
API Request --> Laminar Platform --> Routes to Windows VM --> Computer Use Agent Executes --> JSON Response
```

- Vision-based desktop interaction. No selectors, no coordinates, no scripts that break on UI updates.
- Verification after every action. Catches misclicks before they cascade.
- Gets faster with repeated use. The 100th run is significantly faster than the 1st.
- Scales horizontally across VM pools with automatic routing and failover.
- Full execution replay with screenshots for every run.
